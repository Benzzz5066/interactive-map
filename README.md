This HTML file creates an interactive map web application using Leaflet, an open-source JavaScript library. The map is powered by OpenStreetMap tiles, providing a detailed and customizable map background.

Users can interact with the map by adding markers to any desired location. These markers can represent points of interest, destinations, or any other custom markers as needed. Additionally, the application provides a button labeled "Remove Markers" that allows users to clear all markers from the map with a single click.

This simple web application offers a user-friendly interface for visualizing locations and organizing information on a map. It can be easily customized and extended further based on specific requirements, making it suitable for various use cases such as displaying points of interest, planning routes, or creating interactive maps for websites or applications.
